# Configure Security

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to configure the security in the semantic modeler using the application roles and session variables defined in the previous tasks to filter the data. The Data Filter is where the expression is created that is appended to the OAC Where clause for each query.
Please note Data Filters are not executed for users who explicitly or implicitly have the BI Service Administrator role.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes
